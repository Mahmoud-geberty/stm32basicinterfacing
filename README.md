## code description 
This STM32F4 project demonstrates I2C interfacing with an OLED display. The goal of the project is to display "Hello World" followed by "Stage 3 Complete" on the OLED display. The display is connected to the STM32F4 board using I2C, and the display data is transmitted using the I2C protocol. The code is designed to run on the STM32F4 discovery board, and can be easily adapted to work with other boards that support I2C interfacing. The project serves as a useful demonstration of how to implement I2C interfacing on an STM32F4 board and how to use an OLED display with an STM32F4 board.
